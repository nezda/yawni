## Introduction / Why Yawni and Why WordNet ?
<img alt="Yawning!" align="right" src=".assets/yawni-logo.png">

Yawni is an API to Princeton University's [WordNet®](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/).  WordNet is a graph; it is a potentially 
invaluable resource for injecting knowledge into applications.  WordNet is
probably the single most used NLP resource ; many companies have it as their
cornerstone.  It embodies one of the most fundamental of all NLP problems:
["word-sense disambiguation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation).  The Yawni code library can be used to add lexical
and semantic knowledge, primarily derived from WordNet, to your applications.  
Yawni is written in the Java programming language.  

The Yawni website is <https://www.yawni.org/>

Yawni currently consists of 3 main modules:

[`api/`](https://github.com/nezda/yawni/tree/master/api)
  Yawni WordNet API: a pure Java standalone object-oriented interface to the WordNet
  database of lexical and semantic relationships.

[`data*/`](https://github.com/nezda/yawni/tree/master/data30)
  Yawni WordNet Data: Jar file containing the Princeton WordNet 3.0 data files, and derivative files to support efficient,
  exhaustive access to this information.

[`browser/`](https://github.com/nezda/yawni/tree/master/browser)
  Yawni WordNet Browser: A GUI browser of WordNet content using the Yawni API.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic steps 👣
0. Install JDK 11 (or greater), Apache Maven 3.0.3 (or greater)
1. Specify the following Apache Maven dependencies in your project
    
    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.yawni</groupId>
      <artifactId>yawni-wordnet-api</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.yawni</groupId>
      <artifactId>yawni-wordnet-data30</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
    
2. Start using the Yawni API!: all required resources are loaded on demand
     from the classpath (i.e., jars) made accessible via a singleton:
     
    ```java
    final WordNetInterface wn = WordNet.getInstance();
    ```

   Numerous unit tests that serve as great executable examples are included 
   in [`api/src/test/java/org/yawni/`](https://github.com/nezda/yawni/tree/master/api/src/test/java/org/yawni/).  For a more complex example application, check 
   out the [`browser/`](https://github.com/nezda/yawni/tree/master/browser) sub-module.
     
## Yet Another WordNet Interface !? (get it?)

WordNet consists of enough data to exceed the recommended capacity of Java Collections 
(e.g., `java.util.SortedMap<String, X>`), but not enough to justify a full relational database.

There are a lot of Java interfaces to WordNet already.
Here are 8 of the Java APIs, along with their URL and software license.
- Stanford NLP WordNet <https://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/wn/doc/> ; [“Academic User”](https://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/wn/LICENSE)
- Java WordNet Library <http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~dbikel/software.html#wn> academic license
- JAWS (Java API for WordNet Searching) <http://lyle.smu.edu/~tspell/jaws/index.html>; non-profit
- Jawbone ; <http://sites.google.com/site/mfwallace/jawbone>; MIT license
- JWI (MIT Java Wordnet Interface) ; <http://projects.csail.mit.edu/jwi/>; non-commercial license
- Java WordNet Interface (javawn) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/javawn/>; GPL 2.0
- WordNet JNI Java Native Support (WNJN) ; <http://wnjn.sourceforge.net/> ; GPL 2.0
- JWNL (Java WordNet Library) ; <http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwordnet/>; BSD
- extJWNL (Extended Java WordNet Library) ; <http://sourceforge.net/projects/extjwnl/>; BSD

Many of the pure Java ones (like Yawni), are actually derivatives of Oliver Steele's original JWordNet. In fact, **Yawni** *is* the new name of that original Java WordNet, JWordNet.

# Why Yawni ?
- commercial-grade implementation

  - simple, intuitive, and well documented 📚 API
  - all required resources load from jars by default making deployment a snap 💥
  - all query results are immutable 🔒; safely cached and/or accessed by concurrent threads
  - easy Apache Maven-based build with minimal dependencies

#### Changes in 2.x versions

  - Bloom filters used to avoid fruitless lookups (no loss in accuracy!)
  - re-implemented `LRUCache` using [`Caffeine`](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine)
  - `FileManager.CharStream` and `FileManager.NIOCharStream` utilize in-memory and `java.nio` for maximum speed
- Major reduction in memory requirements
  - use of primitives where possible (hidden by API)
  - eliminated unused / unneeded fields
- Implemented `Morphy` stemming / lemmatization algorithms
- Completely rewritten GUI browser in Java Swing featuring

- Support for WordNet 3.0 data files (and all older formats)
- Support for numerous optional and extended WordNet resources
  - 'sense tagged frequencies' (`WordSense.getSensesTaggedFrequency()`)
