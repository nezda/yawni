Releasing a version
# mvn release:perform -DreleaseProfiles=src,javadoc -Darguments=-Dgpg.passphrase=PASSPHRASE
mvn -DpushChanges=false release:prepare
  * key to getting this working was bumping maven-release-plugin to 2.3.2 (was getting 2.0 as could be verified with mvn help:effective-pom)
  - updates poms from snapshot to a solid version
  - commits
  - updates poms to next snapshot version

  * euphoria: euphoria (CELEX-2 stems “euphoric” to “euphoria”)
  * OK mathematical: mathematics
  * epidemiology: epidemic (CELEX: missing) (WordNet: epidemiologic, epidemiological, epidemiologist - no idea how to get to epidemic)

? why does this web UI to WN 3.0 http://poets.notredame.ac.jp/cgi-bin/wn
  show "microorganism" and "infectious agent" as Pertainyms of "viral" ?
  - these are both immediate hypernyms of the derivationally related source noun "virus" 
    + are derivationally related forms of adjectives "Pertainyms" ? no
    + is this just for "sense context" ? -- appears so, just missing level of indent to show this

- WordNet data omissions
  - derivational link from "employ" → "employable"
  - derivational link from "recursion" → "recusrive"
  - singular form "french fry" (has "french-fry" and "french fries")
  - exceptional spelling for "blogging" (double-'g' form missing)

Release TODOs

- wild idea:
  - do per-RelationType customized behaviors in getRelations() e.g., VERB_GROUP,
    and maybe MERONYM, HOLONYM, DOMAIN
    ! fail: at least for Word, VERB_GROUP would need List<List<RelationArgument>> since it clumps
    - wilder idea: make a MetaSynset/VerbGroup object

- synset groups ; simple pair (Relation) usually suffices
  verb VERB_GROUP
  adj SIMILAR_TO
   - connects satellite adjectives to their head and vice-versa

- what clever things could I do with JavaScript integration ?
  - probably want some little higher-level accessors ?
    - add a debug terminal
      ? how would errors be reported ?
    - maybe want some default includes
  - if fast-boot be desirable, make FileManager.getFileStream() impl configurable ?
  - for some reason, Apple JVM doesn't include Rhino?
    - can be fetched from: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/rhino/js/

//    - seems to be modern way to "hook into" Token stream
//  - related Lucene contrib examples
//    - org.apache.lucene.analysis.shingle.ShingleFilter
//      - constructs shingles (token n-grams) from a token stream, i.e., creates combinations of tokens as a single token.
//    - org.apache.lucene.analysis.sinks.DateRecognizerSinkFilter
//    - org.apache.lucene.analysis.compound.
//      - decomposes 1 token into more than 1 (Germanic languages)
//
// - use Lucene StandardTokenizer (JFlex: fast!)
// - use shingle generator to create alternatives
//   - what pattern does it generate the various shingle lengths in ? (5's, 4's, 3's, 2's, 1's would be ideal :))
//     - don't ultimately, only emit 1 token per position

// - hyperlinking the glosses in the browser would be a good way to exercise this
//    - basically, factors out tokenization and exercises Lucene plumbing

// - learn new Lucene Token/Tokenizer/TokenStream/TokenFilter
//   - AttributeSource
//     - TokenStream
//       - Tokenizer (input isa Reader)
//       - TokenFilter (input isa TokenStream) (Uwe says decorator pattern: TokenFilter adds functionality to a Tokenizer)
//       - TeeSinkTokenFilter.SinkTokenStream
//       - NumericTokenStream

- WordNet online for inspiration
- http://www.yawni.org/wiki/Main/GettingStarted
  - code inspiration from http://aboisvert.github.com/stopwatch/

+ bug: api: issues with checking out and building yawni
  + data sub-project currently needs my jar signature
  + api depends on data
    - couldn't figure out how to make this dependency <optional>; maybe no project-internal concept exists
  + uncommented WNHOME system property
    + got burned by WordNet version (2.1 vs. 3.0)
    - then got burned by WNSEARCHDIR still referencing old version

      can tweak GAE "version" in WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml ; previous versions remain available and web accessisble! e.g., http://5.latest.yawni-online.appspot.com/rest.html

      ./appengine-java-sdk/bin/appcfg.sh --enable_jar_splitting update rest/target/yawni-wordnet-rest-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
  - online version features
    - autocomplete
      - show 'hint' text : conflicts with "default focus" behavior :/
      - fade-in/fade-out of suggestions would be slick (like http://loopj.com/tokeninput/demo.html)
      - support tab / shift-tab navigation like TagDragon (and Firefox search widget)
      - decrease lag from 400ms to less
      - should indicate no known matches; could also try 1 additional search using morphological processing
      - suggesting near-hits would be sweet
  + gae error: "sun.misc.SoftCache is a restricted class"
    + need to use alternate softcache impl
      + Google Collections: ConcurrentMap<K, V> map = MapMaker.softValues().makeMap();

  - feature: online: update appengine-web.xml <version> automatically with Maven; then Google App Engine will version our app !
  - yawni.org color scheme: 
    + orange variant #F79910
  - CSS
    + font-size: 16px 
    + line-height: 24px
  - other typography enhancements
    - color - get inspiration from wordnetweb
    - smart double quotes
    - smart single quotes for single quoted items: `foo' → ‘foo’; 's → ’s
    - bullet between examples ; • (using semicolon)
    x "space" bullet (\u00B7 MIDDLE DOT) between words of collocations ; wild-goose·chase ; attack·dog ; hard·cash
      - only occasionally see this used, and often only for phonetic separation
    + italicize examples; gray text (use BluePrint CSS class alt)
    - em dash where apropos
    - rounded corners:
      - this site uses rounded corners a lot: http://scala-tools.org/mvnsites/maven-scala-plugin/
        -moz-border-radius: 14px 14px 14px 14px !important
      - Tapestry has neat REST service for this: http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4.1/developmentguide/hivemind/roundedcorners.html
      - use div class showgrid to see the BluePrint grid
        <span style="padding: 14px; -moz-border-radius: 14px 14px 14px 14px ! important; background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% white;">

  - design
    + orange background #F79910 (used ColorPicker to get this perfect)
    + white capsule around search box
    + downward facing rounded corners on results
    + issues
      - sense-horizontal-separating bullets are too big (Christine)
      + AJAX active spinner in unusual place
        - maybe closer to search box
      + AJAX active spinner has white background which looks weird on non-white background
        x make it transparent - better to match background colors
        + http://www.ajaxload.info/
      + rounded corners should work in Safari too
      + add search button, if only for aesthetics (searchField activates onBlur anyway)
      + add footer (copyright, etc.)
  ~ links to/from yawni.org
  + meta keywords: WordNet
  - add recent searches on right hand side
    - don't want REST API searches to be shown here

  - REST API can be totally stateless (see Lift example StatelessHtml.scala)
    - David Pollack's advice
      - serialize the forms to JSON and then make an AJAX call on a stable URL
      - new Req.json features will allow easier extraction of JSON from a REST call
        - this combined with disabling the Lift heartbeat should give you stateless support for JSON
    
  - support different versions of WordNet :)
    - should we vary yawni-wordnet-data project version or artifactName ? (or both?)
  - bugs
    + aritfact name is still gae-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war ; change to yawni-online-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    + timed out issues
      - empty responses returned from timed out sessions
      - entry to "waiting" page is ignored; returns empty result !?
      ! likely only occurs on GAE and is caused by 1 request being serviced by multiple JVMs; LiftSession is not fully stored in servlet session, so this clustered servicing fails to behave correctly
    - rounded corners won't work on IE (5,6,7,8)
      http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp
      ? what about Chrome & Opera ?
    + SLF4J impl collision
    + AJAX page seems to reset when page is left and then revisited 
      x searchField focus issue
      x main evidence is from appspot version of app
      x could local and appspot versions running in different tabs be interacting (via cache or otherwise ?)
      + intentional effect of Lift (Session) Garbage collection (heartbeat driven): can be disabled, but not a good idea
        LiftRules.enableLiftGC = false
    + AJAX active spinner not showing
      x something missing in Boot ?
      + src/main/webapp/images/ajax-loader.gif was missing
      + still doesn't work: had to add default hidden div to default.html
    + Blackbird widget not working (yuicompressor-maven-plugin ?)
      + various problems with xhtml and this widget
    + browser scroll bar causes jarring left/right shift
      html { overflow-y: scroll; }

- feature: api: alternate an all caps WordNet term with one with periods after each letter so "CEO" matches input "C.E.O."
  - this article has such an example of "C.E.O.": http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23Netflix-t.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all
- feature: api: expose WordNet data version (e.g., 3.0)
- feature: api: expose About dialog diagnostics as Map (code currently inlined in Browser.java; some of this info in browser.Application)
  - maybe should have Application or Module or something in every subproj
+ feature: api: before initial public release, get names right; rename package org.yawni.wn → org.yawni.wordnet ; rename groupId org.yawni.wn → org.yawni; rename artifactId yawni-core → yawni-wordnet-api; rename artifactId browser → yawni-wordnet-browser

          - how to expose MorphosemanticSemanticRelation ?
            - enums make subclassing impossible 
            - closest existing equivalents are pure-virtual types: MERONYM <- { PART_MERONYM, MEMBER_MERONYM, SUBSTANCE_MERONYM } ...
            - merging them into RelationType and representing them as Relations easiest for users
      - database only contains explicit verb →  noun relations
        ? is inverse implied ?
        ? some verb →  noun instances don't seem to be present ?
          src: breathe%2:29:00::

            →  respiration#1
            →  respiration#3
      * could automate XLS "parsing"/interpretation with Apache POI
        - for easy binary search, duplicate each relation forward and reversed (and overall sorted)
          * note these will have to be divided by POS
      - 14 different morphosematic relations

    - list the atomic elements in WordNet
    - list numbers in WordNet

      ? weird that only 1-30 are nouns (with lexCat <quantity>) while of 31-100, only 40,50,60,78,80,90,100 are nouns, rest adjectives
    - normalize integers (adjectives: 1st →  first, ..., 49th, 50th, 60th,..., 100th, ...,  ? 115th, ..., 130th, ...)

- issues
  - bug: gui: Linux with GTK L&F: GTK+Swing bug causes major focus problems with text fields
    ? maybe only effects older Gnome versions ? (Centos' Gnome 2.16, but not Ubuntu's 2.30)
  - bug: gui: 'release' → verb → Troponyms; first entry only shows word, not Synset
  x feature: api: Synset.getRelations() List<Relation> could be represented as Map<RelationType, List<Relation>>
    - pro: subsumes getRelations(RelationType)
    - cons: Map requires more memory than List ; Relation is already acting as Map.Entry ; Map has no order ; cannot customize (e.g., HYPERNYM implies INSTANCE HYPERNYM)
  - feature: api: parse glosses / examples
    - option 1: simply break gloss definition(s) part and examples part ; getDefintionChunk() / getExampleChunk() ; approach used by wordnet online
    - option 2: break gloss into chunks (?) and examples into chunks ; this functionality is not provided by other libraries
    - option 3: swallow exceptions of failed parses; provide both options
    - option 4: getGlossesAndExamples()
    * the advanced functions are primarily for use in UIs, and could start out in a utility class (e.g., Descriptions)
  - bug: api: RelationArgument (WordSense and Synset) getDescription() / getDescription(boolean) / getLongDescription() / getLongDescription(boolean) methods are a little contrived; they are essentially for UIs only;  a more flexible impl would allow varying lexfile num, ...
    - Describer / Description / Printer / Renderer / java.util.Formatter / java.util.Formattable / java.text.Format / MessageFormat
    - java.util.Formatter - uses Formattable to allow customization of "%s" rendering ; can be parameterized some with FormattableFlags, int length, int precision
      - could add Formattable to Word, WordSense, Synset, POS, Relation, RelationType, Lexname ; doesn't add much to toString()
    - java.util.logging.Formatter - uses LogRecord
    - made rough outline in org.yawni.wordnet.browser.Searcher
  - feature: api: create commandline tool (à la 'wn') based on Command interface ; consider supporting batch mode or RAFCharStream to minimize init lag
  - bug: api: record "Core" missing senseKeys (gvimdiff core active2.sorted)
  - feature: api: simple commandline utilizing synsets(query) / wordSenses(query) akin to 'wn' (e.g., -grep{n|v|a|r})
  - feature: api: add RelationType support to synsets(query) / wordSenses(query) API à la 'wn' (e.g.,  -ants{n|v|a|r}, -hypo{n|v}, -hype{n|v})
  - feature: api: document advantages of synsets(query) / wordSenses(query) API
    + binary compatible experimental API - doesn't effect those who don't use it
    + reduces API clutter making the overall API smaller & less daunting
  - feature: api: can synsets(query) / wordSenses(query) API be cleanly replaced with a builder pattern-based API ?
    + type safe

  ~ feature: api: lookupWordSenses(String someString, POS pos) ; add unit tests; make examples with it
  - feature: api: make stemming optional in lookupSynsets(String someString, POS pos) and lookupWordSenses(String someString, POS pos)
    - currently they combine lookupBaseForms(), lookupWord(), and getWordSenses(): make the lookupBaseForms() part optional (but still on by default)
  - feature: api: coordinate terms (aka sister) terms; nouns or verbs that have the same hypernym (aka 'parent')
    - represent this as a synthetic Relation ?
  + feature: api: add regex support to 'substring search'
  + feature: api: add gloss regex search support ; searchGlossBySubstring
  - bug: api: doc: update Word "substring" search to indicate regex capabilities (and dangers: PatternSyntaxException)
  - bug: api: doc: update gloss "substring" search to indicate regex capabilities (and dangers: PatternSyntaxException)
  + bug: api: added more tests for CharSequenceTokenizer
  + bug: api: substring search incorrectly searching leading license lines of data files; added test
  + bug: api: invalid - just an oddity; values in verb.exc without hits?; about-shipped ; about-shipping; benempt; bird-dogging
  - bug: browser: Maven <profile> inheritance doesn't appear to work correctly: inlining profiles into browser subproject was the only way to create fresh version of the JNLP app with logging dependencies shaded in and proper jar signature
    - if the required profiles are only in parent pom, the following command will report no active profiles

  + bug: api: report more useful exception than NPE when data cannot be found (i.e., not in classpath, $WNSEARCHDIR, or $WNHOME); currently, exceptions look like: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: no stream for noun.exc
  - bug: api: ⊚ $WNSEARCHDIR/$WNHOME environment collison(s) would be confusing to debug; document this
    - feature: api: determine WordNet version at runtime; compute signatures for known versions; key file lengths; key file MD5 sums
  + bug: api: if $WNSEARCHDIR and/or $WNHOME defined, overrides the data jar; apparent when they point it at a real WordNet 2.x dict/ dir (causes test failures)
    * notes from FileManager.getFileStream(String filename, boolean filenameIsWnRelative)
    if YAWNI_USE_JAR, try the jar
      sys prop to guarantee using the jar to prevent weird application-level WN data version mismatches
      - sysprops and environment variables create security issues
      - XXX should this be the default ?
    else if WNSEARCHDIR (or WNHOME) are defined, use them
    - benefits: mmap'd FileChannel requires less memory and inits faster
      - allows simple WN data version changes
    else try the jar
    - zero environment dependencies
    
    What behavior should we use if SecurityException is thrown?
    - this would invariably mean reading local environment variables and arbitrary files from disk was also prohibited so jar is only solution 
    How can we test behavior in a sandboxed environment ?
    
    If we read from jar, do we need user to trust our application at all?
    - may not even need signing in this case - data also delivered as a 
      (8.7MB) jar so not even network reads required)
    
    How can we test behavior in the sandboxed, high security environment?
  + bug: api: gui: default build data/ and use it for unit tests in core/ and browser/ to sidestep environment issues and work in IDEs
  - bug: api: gui: ⊚ add basic Getting Started documentation including slf4j requirements; copy / reference Apache Mina docs on same: http://mina.apache.org/logging-configuration.html
  - bug: api: decrease unit test Xmx -- 256m is excessive; note that base cache sizes form a minimum required memory (esp. if they are filled)
    - 4 active: DEFAULT_CACHE_CAPACITY=10000 (morphyCache, synsetCache, indexWordCache, exceptionsCache)
      - these can easily get fairly large and capture 
  - feature: api: consider public API addition: List<String> getExceptions(CharSequence someString, POS pos)
  + bug: api: include Princeton WordNet license in data subproject !
  < feature: gui: consider left-aligning button/searchField pod; Muller OS X WordNet does this
  - feature: gui: for RelationType dropdowns, consider implementing UI guideline of keeping same set of menu items, but only enabling apropos ones - helps user learn; Muller OS X WordNet does this
    - don't want meta-relations (e.g., MEMBER_MERONYM)
    - only want those RelationTypes applicable to the particular POS
  + bug: api: for Noun "Roman", what yawni calls "Member Meronyms" , wnb calls (Member) Holonyms ("MEMBER OF"); currently have "mero"="#" and "holo"="%" ; doh! wn.h says "mero"="%" and holo="#"
  - feature: gui: typeahead find in Relation PopdownButton menu could support substring "smart" search (e.g., "holo..." in "Member Holonyms"; maybe like QuickSilver's algorithm?)
  + bug: gui: fix UI copy for "The noun kitten has 1 sense (first 1 from tagged texts)"
  < feature: gui: promotion: splash screen would be nice during download and boot; great place to showcase new icon!
  + bug: api: Word.getRelationTypes() sometimes returns an incorrect values for lexical relations (e.g., INSTANCE_*, DERIVATIONALLY_RELATED)
    hypocrite; thinks it has DERIVATIONALLY_RELATED, but this doesn't only applies to other WordSenses in its Synset;
    ? something's not working right:
      palatine (Roman official)
        Roman
  + bug: gui: ADJ Derivationally related forms shows 4 entries, should only be 2; not respecting WordSense-level of the relationship
  + bug: api: gui: "hypocrite" shows derivationally related forms menu option, but nothing shows up (turns out this is correct!)
  + feature: gui: use SwingWorker in preload (ditches explicit Threads, but requires Java 6 (sort of))

  - feature: gui: use simple <span> and some CSS (rules) to modify rendering in resultEditorPane; ideally, controllable from properties file
  + feature: gui: add smart quotes to text of statusLabel prompt to reflect its showing the entered text, e.g., "Overview of roman" → "Overview of “roman”"
  + feature: gui: use dominant case for relation summary copy: "Applies to 4 of the 4 senses of roman" → "Applies to all 4 senses of Roman" (ADJ "roman" → "Derivationally related forms")
  + feature: gui: tweak relation summary copy when numApplicableSenses == senses.size()
    - 3 cases

        " as alternation for “
        " as alternation for ”
      - "therefore" as alternation for ∴ (maybe even ∵ as antonymn); would either of these work to help describe/render WordNet relation entailment ?

    - scoured Interfacelift, found Bombia Design and asked for a quote
      To whom it may concern:
      I am the primary developer of the open source project "Yawni" (Yet Another WordNet API) (http://sourceforge.net/projects/yawni/), a graphical and programmatic interface to WordNet  (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/).  I have been working hard on both the "back end" and UI of the project and even have a concept for an icon.  My concept is a yawning cat (I like this one: http://www.joua.net/paddington/yawn.jpg), possibly vectorized à la vectormagic.com.  I found your portfolios via Interfacelift and was curious what it would cost me to have you create a scalable icon for the project. Obviously I don't have much to spend on this free and open source project, but I think a memorable icon is an important way to promote a project.

      ? how can we create specialized form that is Comparable<T> iff T is Comparable ?

    - convert from BigInteger to more efficient int
    - limit extremely unlikely combos (e.g., 2+ dashes)
      - maybe multi-word getindex() logic doesn't make as much sense for non-NOUNs
    - make these heuristics optional (config param or method param?)
    * Goal: These heuristics should be strict enough to not make stupid mistakes ("I ran" → "Iran", "be an" → bean")
      and loose enough to catch most reasonable variants ("wild goose chase" == "wild-goose chase",
      "wide-screen" == "widescreen")
    - search for "U.S." should match search for "U. S."
      - requires removing space during lookup
    - search for "n. y. stock exchange" should match search for "n.y. stock exchange"
      - requires adding artificial space during lookup
    + search for "internal combustion engine" should match "internal-combustion engine"
      - requires replacing "-" with space during lookup
    o search for "A.M." should match "AM"
    x "U.S." should NOT match "us" - could filter on length ? maybe just a hot word cause its a common preposition ? could filter if has any vowels ? could enforce case ?
    o "V.P." should match "VP"
    o "widescreen" should match "wide-screen"
    o "wild goose chase" should match "wild-goose chase"
    o "f.d. roosevelt" → "f. d. roosevelt" →? "fd roosevelt"
    o "a.k.a." → "aka"
    o "C.E.O." → "CEO"
    o "C.I.A." → "CIA"
    o "Dr." → "Dr" (like "Mr." matches "Mr", though is ambiguous with "Drive")
    o "e.g." → "e.g" →? "eg"
    o "et al" → "et. al." → "et al."
    o "etc." → "etc"

        - intended usage of verb group appears to be for merging senses of a particular word, but transitive closure can cross word boundaries
          - generalized form seems more useful - concept is essentially super-synsets (establishes equivalence, not hyper/hypo -nym because no more general/specific relationship)
      - what form of transitive closure will be most useful ?
        - all same POS (VERB)

  < feature: make L&F preferences (default.xml) based
  - bug: gui: SearchFrame always takes text of BrowserPanel even if it was indirectly, automatically populated via clicking on a SearchFrame list item search result
    - tricky because this field is used to store state used by POS RelationType menus
    - perfect use for SnapBack

    - load default preferences (don't clobber pre-set ones?)
      - what if defaults load itself fails? fail whole program or hard-code default also !?
    - add button/commandline/environment/system variable to trigger reloading defaults.xml
    - preferences modification screen ?
    - Preferences API FTW: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/preferences.html
      which is like a platform-independent Windows registry (note has KEY and
      value size limitations so don't try to store serialized objects in there)
      - how does this interact with Java Web Start ?

  + bug: gui: double-click and triple-click annoying in Search field
    * issue is JTextField only handles double and triple click, but a long
      series of consecutive, temporally adjacent clicks results in getClickCount()s 
      of 4,5,6,.. which are unhandled.

    + undo should trigger focus shift to searchField ? (currently does)
  < feature: make substring search a "drawer" or splitpane like PDF search in Apple Preview
  - feature: gui: add WNHOME assumptions / prompt to splash screen OR installer to Web Start launcher
    - could be as simple as prompting user if environment variable AND Java preference cannot be found

    + these are string level collisions across different POS
      - need to add de-duplicating wrapper (same "word" applies to all POS anyway)
  + bug: fixed issues with reading / storing preferences
  + feature: add statusbar to SearchFrame with search pos, text, and the number
    of hits (maybe "n of m" too) or basic instructions like browser has
    - substring Noun query "irone" has 1 hit - fix statusbar to say "1 result" (not "1 results")

  + feature: almost no indexed based loops now
  + feature: many more RelationType displays are correct now (Adj syns, etc)

+ feature: rename Word → WordSense, IndexWord → Word
  + use Eclipse refactor - much better Java support
    + update docs, browser, example, tests
  + made a proper XCode project
    - probably would be easier with XCode ? - limited Java support

      - would it update javadoc refs too ?
+ feature: gui: revive browser
  + get this to at least compile again
  - where should this go ? 
    * not needed for library to function, although adds no dependencies
      very small increase in jar file size -- maybe who cares ??

< feature: work on Morphy
  * add exact match in 1 spot
  - simplify various parallel arrays (SUFX, ADDR, OFFSETS, CNTS)
  - see getindex() feature
  - NEW fancy search options
    - properly stem / find prefix variants
    - guess to find missing items ("blogging")
    ? consider returning morphologically derived terms ?
  - strive for symmetric search results
    FAQ http://wordnet.princeton.edu/faq#morphology says "the morphological component of WordNet is unidirectional"
    "long time" is a NOUN, "longtime" is an ADJ, both come up in searches for
    "long time", but only the ADJ comes up in searches for "longtime"
  - why doesn't "blogging" → "blog" work ? (double g)
    - seems "running" (double n) is considered an exception ($WNHOME/dict/verb.exc)
    ? maybe morphy should just try this variant ?
    - similar for removing e in shaking hands → shake hands
  - shootout test against Porter stemmer (copy from Lucene)
    - many sublteties here - may stem incorrectly (???), may not (blogging→blog)
  - stem special words: naive → naïve ; resume → résumé
  ~ add unit test to Lucene to ensure equality with Snowball generated Porter stemmer
  - consider integration with Snowball ?
~ feature: api: compare interface summary stats with those in: $WNHOME/dict/log.grind.3.0

- feature: api: doc: measure memory requirements
  - write program to generate report of each lexeme and relation
  - estimate this value -- outline has many of the details
  ? is there a tool to do this ?
  - all IndexWords, Synsets, and Relations 
    - approximate this:
  
  * used 'hat' https://hat.dev.java.net/
    Synset: 76
    Word: 22
    IndexWord: 29
    Relation: 20

  - all caches full

Features / Enhancements
~ feature: api: phase in support for "ALLSENSES" (original WN libraries have this for core search routines (findtheinfo(...) and in_wn(...))
< feature: api: create bounded length longest match algorithm and run over documents
< feature: re-write grind in Java with jflex and/or javacc
  - very old, suspect C code with scary comments in lex file in particular

WordNet features (unexposed)
+ feature: add senses tagged frequency support
  - 90% done - need more tests, caching, and cleanup
  - add unit tests (esp for adj's)
  + add senses tagged frequency to toString()
    - put in Word.getLongDescription()
+ feature: add lexfilename support
  + have lexfilenum gtg (including "inline" copy)
  + String getLexCategory()
+ feature: add support for cntlist.rev
  - $WNHOME/dict/cntlist.rev
  - is $WNHOME/dict/cntlist.rev - mappings to the previous versions senses ?
  ? is this the same as index.sense / sense.idx on Windows ?
    - cntlist.rev is a superset of index.sense - their formats are similar
      cut -d" " -f1,3,4 dict/index.sense > index.sense.no_offsets
      egrep -v " 0\s*$" index.sense.no_offsets > index.sense.no_offsets.non_zero
      wc -l dict/cntlist.rev index.sense.no_offsets.non_zero
      
      37387 dict/cntlist.rev
      35478 index.sense.no_offsets.non_zero (-1909 - changed sense numbers, conflated/dropped senses, etc)
      
+ feature: add support for lexnames 
  - $WNHOME/dict/lexnames
  * already parses lexfilenum
  - for now will only require a byte, but can show an int in the interface
+ bug: verify this Tokenizer nextHexInt() crap - is that for real?
  - all encountered thus far seem correct

Performance
+ bug: cache null values!!!
  - complete ?
< feature: api: convert over to CharSequence and consider using ByteCharBuffer
  - eliminates a lot of immediately discarded String objects
  - eliminates backing char[] storage reqs of longer lived Strings
< feature: api: consider converting Synset's char[] gloss to a UTF-8 encoded byte[] to chop the memory requirements in half for these large strings.
  - 16,557,481 letters (about 32 MB as char so would be about 16 MB as byte)
+ bug: api: use WeakReference's/ WeakReference[] (really I think SoftReference's/SoftReference[])
  + use Google Guava's MapMaker
  * Steele's original code referred to this (was not yet in JDK); see 
  - needs to decide exactly where this might make sense - oddly, this memory saving device could actually cost more than it saves

    Yonik's SimpleStringInterner for lockless pooling
      or maybe ConcurrentLinkedQueue

    graphs = new MapMaper.softKeys().weakValues()
    says weakValues() are poor choice for cache (suggests softValues())

    - does it make more sense to:
      - make the caches have soft values
      - make the interconnections between classes use soft references
      - the interconnectinos which exist
        Word's Synset[] (ALL paged in on demand)
        Synset's List<WordSense> AND List<Relation>
         - we could make many of these things lazy / on-the-fly (e.g., clone the tokenizer)
         * in particular, its likely only a few Relations will be used (e.g., HYPERNYM)
        WordSense's Synset
        Relation's source (target is paged in on demand)

        rough ASCII depiction of the interconnections:

                        v----\
        Word -+→ Synset -+→ WordSense
                         \+→ Relation |→ Synset (src)
                                       |→ WordSense (src)

      - stemming use case only needs Words
      - smart-case stemming needs WordSenses which need Synsets (requires NO Relations)
      - only simple synonyms needs Synsets and WordSenses (requires NO Relations)
      - only hypernyms requires instances of only 1 Relation

      ? what caches exist ?
        - Cache<DatabaseKey, Word> indexWordCache
        - Cache<DatabaseKey, Synset> synsetCache
        - compare the lifetimes of Word and Synset
          - 1 Word pages in n Synsets and keeps hard refs to them
          - nothing maintains refs to Word (∴ makes a lot of sense to cache Words)
            - the memory commitment of a cached Word increases when its Synsets are paged in
              - the amount of WordNet which can be kept alive by the cache can grow pretty large
                - Words bring in batches of Synsets
                - Synsets bring in batches of WordSenses
                - Synsets bring in batches of Relations 
                  - these can select/retain wide swaths of hyponyms and hypernyms
                * Relations seem like biggest cross-connecting memory leak hazard ?
                  - even though they only have hard links in 1 direction, once the 
                    symmetric Relation (e.g., HYPONYM/HYPERNYM) is cached, both subgraphs
                    are snared
                    ... X → Y
                        X ← Y ...
      ? could we add more caches ?
        - WordSense's of a Word
      
      - must have test to compare performance with
        - e.g., unit tests take about 50% longer without synsetCache (didn't dig in to which one; presume threaded antagonizers)
< feature: look for synchronization / liveness opportunities
< feature: make amount of file to mmap configurable
  - test smaller values!!
< bug: use of singleton's prevents comparing distinct instantiations of the DB
< bug: caching AND mmaping together may use too much memory - consider only one or the other or making this configurable
  - unverified -- memory usage seems good
+ feature: using long's for file offets seems like overkill - it's gonna be a while till a plain-text WordNet uses up 4 bytes

General Project Quality
+ bug: run RAT to ensure licenses are all good (http://code.google.com/p/arat/)
~ bug: api: test on Windows, Linux, Mac
~ bug: api: add javadoc to all important methods
  - remove dated/wrong comments regarding original impl
  - remove LN comments ? maybe replace with @author for now ? use tool to compare APIs
  - consider using prose from http://www.w3.org/TR/wordnet-rdf/
+ bug: make sure there are no tab's
+ bug: make sure line endings are all consistent (native and nailed down in svn)

- overhead of java.util.zip is significant source of lag
  - if we don't compress the jar, loading the data takes 139ms
  - if we compress the jar, loading the data takes 480ms

- massive memory efficiency improvement
  - store files as large char arrays and maintain offsets to newlines
    - load takes longer ?
    - maybe using CharSequences backed by CharBuffer is just as good as arrays ?
    - uses more memory ?
      - full caches big too?
        - consider a "WeakReference" based cache
          - if app needs memory for something else, let cache drain
  - String vs ByteCharBuffer
    String
      int offset, int length, int hash, char[] ref and Object and char * length
    Buffer
   
********************************************************************************
   int capacity, limit, mark, position
      ByteBuffer
        Endianess ref
        MappedByteBuffer
          DirectByteBuffer ref, int mapMode, ...
    * key here is re-use, not object size
      - although, offset and length into ByteCharBuffer would be pretty darn compact
  - RelationType[] vs EnumSet<RelationType>
    - RelationType[]
      - object, int length, length * 4 = 16+4*len
    - EnumSet<RelationType>
      - object, Class ref
        MiniEnumSet: 12+4+4+4=24 (tie at len=2)
          - size (int), E[] ref, long // could save 8+4=7 bytes
            - size could even be computed
            - E[] can be pulled from EnumSet.elementClass

- ByteCharBuffer / CharSequence change
  + backing char[] object and content eliminated in many places
    + reduces memory required (large searches, caching, etc)
    + reduces load on garbage collector
  + a ByteCharBuffer is a partially changable CharSequence - its
    position and limit can be changed resulting in it effectively
    "being" a different CharSequence
  - Thread saftey is more of an issue
    - ideally, re-use the Buffer (position, limit)
    - content is only going to be used read-only

  - increased complexity
  - ByteCharBuffer assumes WordNet is ASCII

- selling points for Yawni as an Apache project
  - the ultimate English stemmer (for IR applications, e.g., Lucene)
  - Apache dictionary / lexicon resource
    - really, you need a stemmer to get maximum value out of it - could
      integrate with Lucene's slick new JFlex stemmer as part of a more general
      Apache NLP toolkit
  ? integrate with UIMA project:
    - UIMA - various NLP apps (pos, pchunk, doc/phrase/sentence-similarity (dup filtering), clustering
  - practical lexical semantic web resource
    - synergies with other Apache technologies (W3C RDF/OWL Representation of WordNet)
      http://www.w3.org/TR/wordnet-rdf/
      WordNetRDF http://wordnet.princeton.edu/~agraves/
    - candidate ISO lexicon standard: Lexical Markup Framework (LMF)
  - makes WordNet much more approachable to developers
  - super memory efficient and fast
  - WordNet is an estabished project and no Apache licensed API exists
    - no high quality, pure Java commercial-friendly license exists
